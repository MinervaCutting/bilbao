## TOURS OPTIONS {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### San Sebastian Full day 
* **Duration** 10 hours 
* **Transport** Walking and public transport 
* **Participants** Minimum 10 pax maximum 25 pax  

Visiting only the city center of San Sebastian with old and new town, combined with a walk on the seaside or the beach would already justify your visit  -  but there is also the excellent food with some local specialities and -  of course  - some exceptional architectures we want to show to you:

**«Dealing with the natural surrounding»** is the common topic in the selected modern or historic architecture included in the tour - beeing the additional  highlights to the interesting and worthseeing Oldtown and Newtown

Most famous objects to see are:

**“Peine del viento”-  by E. Chillida and P. Ganchegui**  - an ensemble of sculptures, topographic urban architecture and beautiful landscape.

**Kursaal – by Rafael Moneo**  A building at the border between nature and urban city, built and arranged by the famous architect Rafael Moneo.

**San Telmo Museum – by Nieto and Sobejano**  Dismantled to its original structure by partial demolition, renovation and a cleverly added new extension, the San Telmo Museum presents itself as hidden architectural masterpiece of San Sebastian

**Club Náutico - by José Manuel Aizpurua** Like a white oceanliner the sailing club is located as icon of the international style in front of the old town.

Depending on the final itinerary,  it is possible to add more objects as the walk along the **Paseo Nuevo** with a **sculpture of J. Oteiza,** the city squares of the old town and the recently finished **Church at Riberas de Loiola – by Rafael Moneo**
